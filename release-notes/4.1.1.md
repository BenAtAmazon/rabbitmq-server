## RabbitMQ 4.1.1

RabbitMQ `4.1.1` is a maintenance release in the `4.1.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).

Starting June 1st, 2024, community support for this series will only be provided to [regularly contributing users](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md) and those
who hold a valid [commercial support license](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).

It is **strongly recommended** that you read [4.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
in detail if upgrading from a version prior to `4.1.0`.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

This release requires Erlang 26 and supports Erlang versions up to `27.3.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.

Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * [Default queue type](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts#default-queue-type) is now injected into virtual host metadata when the virtual host
   is created.

   This seemingly subtle change elimiantes confusing inconsistencies between different
   definition export methods and scenarios.

   GitHub issue: [#13854](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13854)

 * Empty classic queues init faster after a clean shutdown.

 * Quorum queue failed to recover from a rare timeout during cluster formation.

   GitHub issue: [#13828](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13828)

   a SAC consumer.

### CLI Tools

#### Enhancements

 * `rabbitmq-queues force_checkpoint [--vhost-pattern <pattern>] [--queue-pattern <pattern>]`
